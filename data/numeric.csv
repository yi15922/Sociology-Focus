Thank you for participating! This survey is being conducted to meet a course requirement with oversight of Duke Sociology Professor Lynn Smith-Lovin. 

 

Any data collected through this survey will not be made public and we do not collect any information that could identify you. 

 

The purpose of this project is to understand people’s feelings about certain concepts. The survey has three parts: The first part of this study asks some demographic questions to see if you qualify for this study. During the second part, you will rate some concepts on a sliding scale. A third part will ask you some additional demographic questions. We do not anticipate any risks to study participants.

 

Your participation is entirely voluntary. If, after reading this, you do not want to participate, simply select “I do not want to participate” at the bottom of this page and your participation will end. You are free to withdraw consent and discontinue participation in this study at any time for any reason. 

 

If you have any questions about this survey, please ask me know. If you have questions at a later time, you can contact me. You can also contact Professor Lynn Smith-Lovin at smithlov@soc.duke.edu For questions about your rights, contact the Institutional Review Board at 919-684-4769 or campusirb@duke.edu 

 

By clicking “I agree to participate,” you are indicating that you understand the survey description above and that you agree to participate.","You will rate your feelings about concepts with a slider, shown below. You can move the slider from one extreme to the other. The ends of the slider represent the most extreme conditions imaginable. The middle represents neither extreme; the middle is neutral.","Here, the ends of the slider represent bad/awful (left) versus good/nice (right). Try rating ""a farmer."" Is ""a farmer"" typically bad/awful or good/nice? Base your rating on your first impression, rather than on logical reasoning.

 



 

a farmer is

 

Bad, Awful

Good, Nice","Here, the slider has been placed in the neutral position. Placing the slider in this position would mean ""a farmer"" is neither bad/awful nor good/nice. To rate a concept as neutral you must move the slider slightly and then return it to neutral.


 

a farmer is

 

Bad, Awful

Good, Nice","Here, the extremes let you rate whether a concept is powerless/little (left) or powerful/big (right). Notice that after you clicked ""Next,"" the concept, ""a farmer"" did not change. Rather the endpoints changed from bad/awful versus good/nice to powerless/little versus powerful/big. Try rating ""a farmer"" using these extremes. Is ""a farmer"" typically powerless/little or powerful/big?
